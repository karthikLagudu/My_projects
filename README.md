Importing Modules :

The code starts by importing the necessary modules:

tkinter (as tk): Used for creating a graphical user interface (GUI).
messagebox: A submodule of tkinter used for displaying message boxes.





BMI Calculation Functions:

calculate_bmi(weight, height): Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) given the weight (in kilograms) and height (in centimeters).

Converts height from centimeters to meters.
Computes BMI using the formula: BMI=height2weight​

Rounds the result to two decimal places.
Handles the case where height is zero (to avoid division by zero).


categorize_bmi(bmi): Categorizes the BMI value into different weight categories (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese).



Button Click Event Handlers:

calculate_button_click(): Called when the “Calculate” button is clicked.

Retrieves weight and height values from the input fields.
Calls the calculate_bmi function to compute BMI.
Updates the result_label with the calculated BMI and its category.


save_bmi_data(): Called when the “Save Data” button is clicked.

Retrieves weight and height values from the input fields.
Calls the calculate_bmi function to compute BMI.
Appends BMI data (weight, height, BMI, and category) to a text file named “bmi_data.txt”.
Displays an info message box indicating successful data saving.





Creating the GUI:

A main window (root) is created using tk.Tk().
Labels, entry fields, buttons, and a label for displaying results are added to the GUI using tk.Label, tk.Entry, and tk.Button.
The result_label will show the calculated BMI and its category.



Main Event Loop:

The root.mainloop() call starts the main event loop, which keeps the GUI window open and responsive.
When the user interacts with the GUI (e.g., clicks buttons), the associated functions are executed.



User Interaction:

The user enters weight and height in the input fields.
Clicking the “Calculate” button computes the BMI and displays it.
Clicking the “Save Data” button saves BMI data to a text file.
